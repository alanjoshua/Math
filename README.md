# Math

This is a simple Linear Algebra library I created as I worked on my 3D rendering engine project. 

This is also a very new and ongoing project so I haven't gotten around to cleaning up and commenting the code yet.
<\br>

I added functions and features as I came across a need for them while working on my project and so 
might not have a lot of functions and features you might find in a fulll fledged math library.


This is solely for furthering my knowledge in math algorithms and so I decided to create my own math library instead of making use 
of an existing library.


This library does not make use of optimizations and does not make use of the GPU so this would probably be much slower than more 
full fledged math libraries.


I eventually plan on adding optimisations such as using the GPU and usage of optmized algorithms as my 3D rendering engine project 
becomes more mature. 


Thank you for taking your time in reading this.
