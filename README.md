# Math

<p>This is a simple Linear Algebra library I created as I worked on my 3D rendering engine project.</p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>This is also a very new and ongoing project so I haven't gotten around to cleaning up and commenting the code yet.</p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>I added functions and features as I came across a need for them while working on my project and so 
might not have a lot of functions and features you might find in a fulll fledged math library.</p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>This is solely for furthering my knowledge in math algorithms and so I decided to create my own math library instead of making use 
of an existing library.</p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>This library does not make use of optimizations and does not make use of the GPU so this would probably be much slower than more 
full fledged math libraries.</p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>I eventually plan on adding optimisations such as using the GPU and usage of optmized algorithms as my 3D rendering engine project 
becomes more mature. </p>

<p>Thank you for taking your time in reading this.</p>
